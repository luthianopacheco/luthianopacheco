# Luthiano Pacheco
Full-Stack Developer from Porto Alegre/RS, Brazil. Focused in Flutter/Dart (mobile and web frontend) with experience in Node.js and Firebase.

As a Full-Stack Developer at Volters, I led the frontend development of a new Flutter platform from scratch, defining its architecture, state management, libs, etc, in addition to collaborating with the backend team. My background also includes contributing to new features on Android/iOS/Web applications at daGinga.
